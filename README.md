# Gitflow integration for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides integration and support for [gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
It is based on [this gitflow implementation](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)
and intends to be (but is not yet) fully compatible with it.

# IMPORTANT

This is an *early version*, and it currently only supports the following basic
gitflow features:

- Repository initialization
- Feature branches
- Feature branch rebasing
- Release branches
- Release tagging

The following features are _**not yet**_ implemented:

- Hotfix branches
- Support branches

It's incomplete, but the existing supported features should work.

Development is ongoing. Please help support this project by trying it out
and submitting issues and feature requests to [the github page](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/vscode-gitflow).
