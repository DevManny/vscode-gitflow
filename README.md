# Gitflow integration for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides integration and support for [gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
It is based on [this gitflow implementation](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)
and intends to be fully compatible with it.

# IMPORTANT

This is a very early version, and currently only supports the following gitflow
 features:

- Repository initialization
- Feature branches

The following (many) features are _**not yet**_ implemented:

- Release branches
- Release tagging
- Hotfix branches
- Support branches
- Branch rebasing

As you can see, it's pretty incomplete. Development is ongoing!
